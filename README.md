# TODO
* Static miner
* When rcl==2, spawn first miner and build container

* Logger, turn on and off debug logs
* If enemy present, prioritize hauling to towers
* Go to closest instead of 0
* long distance harvesters that builds containers and repairs them. When done, spawn long distance haulers (faster)
* Store targets in memory instead of calculating new every tick
* Rewrite creep prototypes.
